# Vibe Coding Hackathon

Welcome to the Vibe Coding Hackathon! This repository contains example documentation to help you understand how to develop applications using Vibe Coding.

## Repository Overview

This repository includes a sample project (Greenhouse Management System) that demonstrates how to structure requirements, technical documentation, and design specifications for a software project. The Greenhouse Management System is provided as an example only - you will be working on your own project during the hackathon.

## Example Project Structure

The sample Greenhouse Management System project demonstrates how documentation can be organized:

- **0-Prelim**: Contains preliminary information including meeting transcripts
- **1-SystemRequirements**: Business requirements document
- **2-TechnicalDocuments**: Technical specifications including:
  - Technical Architecture
  - Screen Breakdown
  - API Specification
  - Database Design
  - Sequence Diagrams
- **3-DesignDocuments**: Visual and UX guidelines including:
  - Design Guidelines
  - Color Palette
  - Screen Design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js (latest LTS version)
- npm or yarn
- Basic knowledge of Next.js, React, and TypeScript

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Hackathon-052025
```

### Your Hackathon Project

During this hackathon, you'll be developing your own project using Vibe Coding. You can use the example Greenhouse Management System documentation as a reference for how to structure your own project requirements and specifications.

For your hackathon project:

1. Create a new folder for your implementation
2. Define your own project requirements
3. Use Vibe Coding to accelerate your development
4. Apply best practices for code organization and documentation

## Suggested Technical Stack

You're free to choose your own technical stack for your hackathon project, but here's what's used in the example project:

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Material-UI components, PWA capabilities
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Storage**: S3-compatible storage

Feel free to use a different stack that best suits your project's needs.

## Using Vibe Coding

This hackathon leverages Vibe Coding to help you prototype quickly. Vibe Coding uses AI to accelerate development by:

1. Generating code based on specifications
2. Providing guidance on implementation details
3. Helping troubleshoot issues
4. Ensuring code quality and standards adherence

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create your project implementation in your own folder
2. Document your project requirements and specifications
3. Include a README within your project folder explaining:
   - The problem your project solves
   - How to set up and run your application
   - Any additional libraries or tools you've used
   - How Vibe Coding helped accelerate your development
   - Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them

## Example Resources

You can refer to the following example documents to understand how to structure your own project documentation:

- Business Requirements: `/1-SystemRequirements/BusinessRequirements.md`
- Technical Architecture: `/2-TechnicalDocuments/1-TechnicalArchitecture.md`
- Screen Breakdown: `/2-TechnicalDocuments/2-ScreenBreakdown.md`
- API Specification: `/2-TechnicalDocuments/3-APISpec.md`

Remember, these are provided as examples only - your project can have a completely different structure and focus.

Good luck, and happy coding!
