# Greenhouse Management System (GMS) Hackathon

Welcome to the Greenhouse Management System (GMS) Hackathon! This repository contains all the necessary documentation to help you develop a modernized hazardous materials inspection system using Vibe Coding.

## Project Overview

The Greenhouse Management System is designed to streamline the inspection and reporting process for hazardous materials management, specifically focusing on asbestos and other hazardous materials inspection workflows. The system aims to convert existing paper-based forms to electronic format, integrate with existing tools, and automate report generation.

## Repository Structure

- **0-Prelim**: Contains preliminary information including meeting transcripts
- **1-SystemRequirements**: Business requirements for the Greenhouse Management System
- **2-TechnicalDocuments**: Technical specifications including:
  - Technical Architecture
  - Screen Breakdown
  - API Specification
  - Database Design
  - Sequence Diagrams
- **3-DesignDocuments**: Visual and UX guidelines including:
  - Design Guidelines
  - Color Palette
  - Screen Design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js (latest LTS version)
- npm or yarn
- Basic knowledge of Next.js, React, and TypeScript

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Hackathon-052025
```

### Project Implementation

Your task is to implement a Next.js application in a new `/project` folder, following the screen breakdown and technical architecture specified in the documentation. Key requirements include:

1. Implement SSO authentication with Google and Microsoft
2. Create a demo login option for testing purposes
3. Follow the technical architecture specified in the documentation
4. Implement the screens as outlined in the screen breakdown document
5. Include all API endpoints as detailed in the API specification

## Technical Stack

As specified in the technical architecture:

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Material-UI components, PWA capabilities
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Storage**: S3-compatible storage

## Using Vibe Coding

This hackathon leverages Vibe Coding to help you prototype quickly. Vibe Coding uses AI to accelerate development by:

1. Generating code based on specifications
2. Providing guidance on implementation details
3. Helping troubleshoot issues
4. Ensuring code quality and standards adherence

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create your implementation in the `/project` folder
2. Ensure your code follows the technical specifications
3. Include a brief README within your project folder explaining:
   - How to set up and run your application
   - Any additional libraries or tools you've used
   - Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them

## Resources
